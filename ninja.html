							<p> <b>"Stealth"</b> is an engaging <b>2D platformer</b> that is a mix of <b>action</b>, <b>movement precision</b>, and <b>strategic 
								enemy encounters</b> within a dynamic environment. In this project, I explored how to create a <b>fluid</b> and <b>immersive</b> gameplay 
								experience that challenges players while maintaining fairness 
								and responsiveness. I achieved this by implementing core mechanics such as <b>enemy AI</b>, <b>dynamic platforming</b>, <b>player 
								detection systems</b>, <b>animations</b>, and <b>environmental interactions</b>.
								<br>
								<br>
								One of the central mechanics I introduced is <b>enemy logic</b>, where enemies not only patrol the environment but also dynamically 
								respond to player presence. They can detect the player using <b>raycasts</b> and alter their movement patterns accordingly.
								<br>
								<br>
								The <b>enemies</b> in my game serve as dynamic obstacles that challenge the <b>playerâ€™s movement</b>, <b>timing</b>, and <b>strategy</b>. 
								Each enemy has unique behaviors that force the player to adapt and interact with them in different ways.
								<ul>
									<li>
										The Camera Enemy is a stationary but
										dangerous foe that continuously scans its surroundings. It rotates within a limited angle 
										range and, upon detecting the player, stops moving and begins firing projectiles with 
										rapid precision. To avoid being spotted, the player must utilize movement strategies such 
										as jumping, hiding, or using invisibility to slip past undetected.
									</li>

									<li>
										The Red Ninjas are the most aggressive and relentless enemies in the game. 
										They <b>patrol platforms</b>, detect the player from a distance, and chase with 
										increased speed. Once they engage, they swiftly close the distance and 
										strike with fast melee attacks. Their design includes edge detection to 
										prevent them from falling off platforms, and they react dynamically to the 
										player's position. When spotted, the player has to decide between 
										fighting back, outmaneuvering them, or using invisibility to escape.
									</li>
									
								</ul>
