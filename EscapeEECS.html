							<p> <b>"Escape EECS"</b> is a first-person horror puzzle game where players must escape a locked-down school while being stalked by a hostile 
								janitor. To survive, players must solve environmental puzzles—such as unscrewing vents to escape—while using objects in the environment 
								to distract the janitor and avoid detection. The janitor actively reacts to sound, destroys hiding spots out of frustration, and can 
								catch and kill the player in a dramatic, animated cutscene. With immersive light-based object guidance, a checkpoint system, and 
								cinematic storytelling, the game blends stealth, strategy, and suspense to create a tense escape experience.
								<br>
								<br>
								Throughout development, I contributed to many of the core gameplay systems that define the player’s interaction with the world and the janitor,
								including player interactions, audio interactions, cutscene camera transitions, level design, and player death sequences.
								<br>
								<br>
								This game was developed using Unity and scripted in C#, leveraging Unity’s animation, physics, NavMesh, and coroutine systems. 
								Working on this project taught me invaluable skills in managing projects, animation event handling, game 
								architecture, and building suspenseful player experiences through interactive narrative and game mechanics.
